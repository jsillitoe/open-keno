### Standard Keno
Keno is a simple game of luck where the player chooses numbers and hope as many as possible match those randomly drawn 

#### Rules

1. The player makes a wager and indicates which numbers he wishes to pick. The picks are made on a slip of paper in live keno and by touching the screen in video keno. The range of numbers the player may pick from is 1 to 80.
2. The number of picks the player may make depends on the game itself. Usually the range is 2 to 10 or 1 to 15.
3. The game will randomly choose 20 out of 80 balls.
4. If the game chooses a number the player chose that is known as a "catch." The player is paid according to the number of balls he catchs.

### Power Keno

The rules in Power Keno are the same as standard keno, except if the player catches the 20th ball drawn, then any winnings are quadrupled.

### Super Keno

The rules in Super Keno the same as standard keno, except if the player catches the 1st ball drawn, then any winnings are quadrupled.

### Top-Bottom Keno

Top-bottom keno pays according to how many balls fall into a half (top or bottom) chosen by the player.
